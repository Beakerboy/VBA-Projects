# VBA-Projects

This repository contains several VBA functions:

Intervals:
  These function produce intervals from sets of data. Similar to how the "forcast" function evealuates a least-squares data fit at a specific point, these function produce the confidence interval or prediction interval at a particular point for a set of data.
  
Ellipse:
  This function will return x and y values for an ellipse that encloses a given set of data at a specific number of standad deviations.
  
LOESS:
  This function applys the LOESS smoothing algorithm to a set of data
  
Violin:
  Violin Charts in Excel. Kernel Denisty estimates are produced from descrete data to produce range objects that can be plotted in a chart.
  
Root:
  Root-finding methods. Currently can calculate closed form solutions to polynomials up to 4th degree.
